# Benefit-Cost Analysis of Dam Construction Projects

## Overview
This repository presents a meticulous benefit-cost analysis centered around two dam construction projects proposed for JET Corporation. Employing the triangular probability distribution, we delve deep into the potential costs and benefits linked with each project, aiming to pinpoint the most economically sustainable choice.

## Introduction
Cost-benefit analysis, a robust tool in financial modeling, seeks to evaluate anticipated costs against potential benefits for a project option. Beyond tangible financial parameters, intangible benefits like customer satisfaction occasionally factor in. For JET Corporation's context, we're dealing with two dam construction prospects, each presenting six potential benefit avenues.

## Goal
To crystallize an informed recommendation, detailing which dam project JET Corporation should funnel its investments into.

## Methodology

### Triangular Probability Distribution
Utilized extensively in business realms, this distribution acts as our foundational pillar due to its minimal data requirements. It leverages three primary data points - the lowest value `a`, peak value `c`, and the highest value `b`.

### Benefit-Cost Ratio
This ratio, derived from total benefits versus total costs, offers a lucid perspective on the prospective return on investment.

### Simulation
Harnessing the power of 10,000 simulations, we orchestrate a myriad of scenarios to encapsulate a broad spectrum of benefits and costs. This vast data pool then steers our project recommendations.

### Chi-squared Test
This statistical test gauges the goodness of fit, assessing how well the observed data aligns with the expected data in our study.

### Descriptive Statistics
Essential statistical metrics like the upper and lower bounds, variance, standard deviation, and skewness of the Benefit Cost Ratio get deciphered for each dam.

## Results
- Dam 1's BCR Benchmark: 1.55
- Dam 2's BCR Benchmark: 1.40

Our simulations draw a clear picture: Dam 1's cost-benefit ratio trumps Dam 2's in an impressive 55%+ scenarios.

## Conclusion
While both dam initiatives hold the promise of lucrative returns for stakeholders, Dam 1 subtly edges out with a higher likelihood of a superior cost-benefit ratio. Our simulations also intimated that Dam 1's ratio surpasses Dam 2's in a significant majority of the modeled cases.
